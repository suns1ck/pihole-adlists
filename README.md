Domain lists focused on reclaiming the right to privacy and the ability to look at a screen without a painful amount of ads. ðŸ’›

The point of this repo is to consolidate a large amount of lists into what I feel will be more usable ones. Feel free to clone and modify it to fit yours if needed!

A large part of these lists came from StevenBlack's [hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts?tab=readme-ov-file) repo, so a big thank you to them and the people who've contributed to those lists.
